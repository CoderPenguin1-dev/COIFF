# Cinder's Own Interactive Fiction Framework
COIFF is a basic framework made for "choose-your-own-adventure" style games (often called storygames).

The framework is split into two main parts, the Engine and the Frontend.
* The [Cinder Engine](CinderEngine) runs the game's logic.
* The [Flame](Flame) frontend shows data to the player and allows them to actually make choices.

Please check the [Documentation](Docs/README.MD) for information on the engine.
