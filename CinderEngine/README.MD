# Cinder Engine
The Cinder Engine is an engine purpose-built for choice-based storygames made in .NET 10.0.

Made to be easy yet flexible, it allows the writer to just worry about writing without needing to worry about actual programming unless they wish for extended logic.

The engine itself does implement Lua as a scripting language. Information can be found in the [Documentation](../Docs/README.MD).

Cinder Engine requires a frontend for any story file to be viewed. The official one is [Flame](../Flame).
